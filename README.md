# Evaluate-Stellar-Cluster-SED
This repository contains a set of functions used to evaluate the SED of a stellar cluster to provide estimations of its age, metallicity, mass and V-band extinction using synthetic stellar populations generated by version 2.2 of The Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis code (BPASS). Two evaluations are made, one using a single-star BPASS v 2.2 model set and another using a binary BPASS v 2.2 model set. This code is provided as supplementary material to an investigation regarding the effects of accounting for binary-star interactions when evaluating the unresolved photometry of stellar clusters.
