# Evaluate-Stellar-Cluster-SED
This repository contains a set of functions used to evaluate the SED of a stellar cluster to provide estimations of its age, metallicity, mass and V-band extinction. Two evaluations are made, one using a single-star BPASS v 2.2 model set and another using a binary BPASS v 2.2 model set.
